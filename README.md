# Mobile Money Service

## Introduction
Welcome to Humphrey's Mobile Money Service! A Mobile Money Service is a platform provided by mobile telecommunication providers that enables users to make financial transactions with their mobile phones. Using C++, I have designed a program that mimics or replicates this system. This simple C++ program allows users to perform basic mobile money transactions such as authentication, pin reset/change, balance check, and money transfer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is not an actual mobile money service, just a replication of it. All transactions made using this program do not involve the use of real money.
