- Mobile Money Service is a platform provided by mobile telecommunication providers that enables users to make financial transactions with their mobile phones. Using C++, I have designed a program that mimics or replicates this system. 
The program should at the minimum include these features 
1. Authentication 
2. Resetting/changing Pin 
3. Checking balance 
4. Sending money
- Basic Conditions 
1. Default pin 0000 
2. Default balance 1,000 
3. After 3 wrong pin entries, the program should exit. 
4. Program should continue executing until an exit option is selected.
